# Divisors

# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a
# list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly
# into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

number = int(input("Enter a number to divide: "))

x = list(range(1,number+1))
print(x)
a = []
for elem in x:
    if(number % elem == 0):
        a.append(elem)
print(a)
